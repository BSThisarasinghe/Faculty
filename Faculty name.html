<div id="box1"><p><h3>The Faculty of Applied Sciences of the Sabaragamuwa University of Sri Lanka was initially started as the Buttala Affiliated University College (BAUC) on 21st June 1993. The BAUC offered two diploma courses, one in Food Science and Technology and the other in English Language. With the elevation of the Affiliated University Colleges to fully fledged national Universities in early 1996, three Affiliated University Colleges; Sabaragamuwa Affiliated University College, Uva Affiliated University College and Buttala Affiliated University College were amalgamated to form the Sabaragamuwa University of Sri Lanka and the BAUC became the Faculty of Applied Sciences of the Sabaragamuwa University of Sri Lanka. With effect from March 2008, the faculty has been relocated in the main campus premises at Belihuloya.</h3></p>
